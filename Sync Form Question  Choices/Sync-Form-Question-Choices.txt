Purpose: Sync answer choices on two different forms using the same dynamic list based on form submissions

Example Use: Players and leaders must check in for an event and can do so from two different forms (one for customers, one for employees).
Players must select their leader when they check in, so the list of options on both forms has to be able to update immediately when any leader checks in.

You will need:
- 2 Google Form IDs (go into Edit mode and grab the long alphanumeric section of the URL)
- A Google Sheet with your answer options populated into a column (both form responses should feed into the same list)

Sections:
- Function to update the questions with the shared answer list
-- Subfunction to obtain the individual question IDs on each form
- Function to create a trigger to update when each form is submitted

How to implement:
Follow the commented setup. Note the code snippet for finding individual question IDs.

Drawbacks:
- Getting your shared answer list into the correct place in Sheets so it can be grabbed by a script is sometimes fiddly (the 'query' function is great for this).
- Resetting the answer list requires a running the function manually when the list is empty, or you can set another trigger on your own (i.e. clearing the list at 2am daily).
- If you edit your forms or remake your questions, you need to grab the IDs again.
