Purpose: Open and close form responses in sync with Google calendar event times, limited to specific events with a keyword in their title.

Example Use: Allowing players to check into an event when they arrive to track attendance at tabletop events, while preventing them from checking in when an event isn't running.
We put general game announcements and release dates on the same calendar, hence the title filter for actual events players can attend.

You will need:
- A Google Calendar's name (usually your email unless you named it something specific)
- A Google Form's ID (go into Edit mode and grab the long alphanumeric section of the URL)

Sections:
- Function to check the calendar for valid events
- Function to create a timed trigger to open the form
- Function to create a timed trigger to close the form

How to implement:
Follow the commented setup and set the main checkCalendar() function to run daily.

Drawbacks:
- Running the function more frequently than once daily can cause duplicate triggers to be created for events that existed during both runs.
- Adding an event after the function runs means triggers won't be created and you'll have to run checkCalendar() manually.
