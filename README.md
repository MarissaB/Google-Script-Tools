# Google-Script-Tools
Some useful Google Scripts I've pieced together for use in other projects.

The two folders in this project are for a pair of useful scripts.

One will allow Google Form question options to sync and update from multiple form submissions.
Example: Allow names to be input from customer check-ins as well as employee check-ins. The question with names as answers will be updated.

The other will open and close a Google Form based on a repeating calendar event.
Example: Open the check-in form before an event starts and close it when the event finishes.
